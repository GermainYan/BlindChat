As part of our course it was a question for usto build and evaluate a prototype including a concept for cooperation without pixels.
That mean's no classic agraphical user interface allowed(Lighting in objects ,tactiles, vibrations,voice interaction,gestures).Blindchat is an application that allows oral communication between two people with an Android smarphone without using a graphical tool. How is it work? when the user shakes the phone and then he can easily communicate with his friend, equal to the distance that separates them from each other, the most important thing is that both must have an internet connection. Our document is divided into several parts, namely the study of existing applications for the blind, the different communication concepts (Association, Direction of infosflow, Mode of communication) and cooperation used in our application. Then the evaluation for the collection and analysis of user feedback in relation to our application.
