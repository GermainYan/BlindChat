Since the dawn of time, communication has been created in order to allow human beings to be able to exchange their ideas. 
However, this communication has evolved since this period. Nowadays we find it in several forms namely: verbal, written but also gestural. 
However, this development has not always been in favor of visually impaired or blind people. 
Because of their visual handicap, the use of different technological communication tools is not always easy for those. 
To facilitate the communication between these people by creating an application who will not need a graphical interface and who will use movement 
sensor to define somes instructions like sending messages or playing messages.For its implementation we used several free tools. 
Firebase for managing and storing voice messages, Android studio for developing the application.
After its implementation we carried out an assessment of our application during which we collect the daily different user reviews.
